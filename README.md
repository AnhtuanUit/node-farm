# Node-Farm: Learning Node.js

Welcome to Node-Farm, a simple Node.js project designed for learning and practicing core concepts. This project provides hands-on experience with essential Node.js skills, drawing inspiration from the ["Node.js, Express, MongoDB & More: The Complete Bootcamp 2024"](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/) Udemy course.

**Note:** The live demo is hosted on a free hosting service, and it may take about 1 or 2 minutes for the server to wake up if it's in a sleeping state.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnhtuanUit/node-farm.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Ensure nodemon is installed globally (if not already):**

   ```bash
   npm install -g nodemon
   ```

4. **Run the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Key Features and Concepts Covered

1. **File System Operations:**

   - Demonstrates file read and write operations in Node.js.
   - Highlights the difference between blocking and non-blocking I/O.

2. **HTML Templating:**

   - Builds and fills HTML templates with data using manual parsing techniques.

3. **Core Module Usage:**

   - Creates routes using core modules in Node.js without relying on external frameworks like Express.

4. **URL Parsing:**

   - Manually parses URLs from the browser to understand the underlying mechanisms.

5. **Module Creation:**

   - Develops custom Node.js modules to encapsulate functionality and enhance code modularity.

6. **npm Module Management:**
   - Introduces npm, including installing external packages, specifying package versions, and updating packages.

## npm Packages Used

- `eslint`, `eslint-config-airbnb`, `eslint-config-prettier`, `eslint-plugin-import`, `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, `eslint-plugin-node`, `eslint-plugin-prettier`, `eslint-plugin-react`: For linting and maintaining code quality.
- `prettier`: Code formatter for consistent code styling.
- `nodemon`: Monitors changes in files and automatically restarts the server during development.

## Course Inspiration

- This project is a part of the learning journey inspired by the ["Node.js, Express, MongoDB & More: The Complete Bootcamp 2024"](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/) Udemy course.
